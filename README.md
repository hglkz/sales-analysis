# Overview
In this project, I examined trends in 2021 sales of bike stores located in Spain. The dataset was comprised of the following tables: sales, customers, locations, products, sales_agents, and stores. I examined the main KPIs, including total revenue, profit, and profit margin, number of repeat customers, monthly sales trend, and sales trends by region. 

The analysis revealed a spike in bike sales in the 4th quarter of the year. The majority of this spike can be attributed to the sales made in the region of Castilla y Le칩n. 

The analysis further demonstrates that over 50% of the overall sales can be attributed to the three (out of 16) top performing regions: Castilla y Le칩n, Arag칩n, and Catalu침a.

# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from FP20 Analytics 2023 dataset https://www.fp20analytics.com/datasets-2023 (name: San Martin's Stores Analysis).

# Dependencies
MySQL Workbench 8.0.36 was used to write and execute tests on SQL queries. Python (pandas, numpy) and Excel were used to clean the dataset.
