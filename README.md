# Overview
In this project, I investigated sales trends for bike stores in Spain in 2021. The dataset included tables such as sales, customers, locations, products, sales_agents, and stores. 

I analyzed key performance indicators like total revenue, profit, profit margin, number of repeat customers, monthly sales trends, and regional sales trends.

The analysis uncovered a significant increase in bike sales during the fourth quarter, primarily driven by sales in the Castilla y Le칩n region. Additionally, it revealed that over 50% of total sales originated from just three of the 16 regions: Castilla y Le칩n, Arag칩n, and Catalu침a.

# Dataset
The dataset was sourced from FP20 Analytics 2023 dataset https://www.fp20analytics.com/datasets-2023 (name: San Martin's Stores Analysis).

# Dependencies
MySQL Workbench 8.0.36 was used to write and execute tests on SQL queries. Python (pandas, numpy) and Excel were used to clean the dataset.
